Three machine learning projects with popular kaggle datasets. These are basic machine learning projects that you can learn quickly.

Youâ€™ll learn to use different Python libraries like;
- OneHotEncoder: to transform one or more categorical features into numerical dummy features useful for training machine learning model
- SimpleImputer: helpful in handling the missing data in the predictive model dataset
- ColumnTransformer: allows different columns or column subsets of the input to be transformed separately 
- Pipeline: a tool that chains all steps of the workflow together for a more streamlined procedure
- StandardScaler: for standardization

And many other Sklearn libraries useful for machine learning
